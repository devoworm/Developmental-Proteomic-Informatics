## Welcome to the Developmental Proteomics Informatics for _C. elegans_ project.

### This bioinformatics pipeline was constructed by Suroush Bastani over Summer 2024.

__Instructions:__
1. Each .zip file includes two .json files that must be used in conjunction with the Biopython-pipeline.ipynb file.

2. Biopython pipeline communicates with the [NCBI Protein Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein). 

3. For additional methods, please see the methods from the following paper: Alicea, B., Bastani, S., Gordon, N.K., Crawford-Young, S., and Gordon, R.G. (2024).
